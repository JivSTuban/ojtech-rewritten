# Email Debugging Guide - Enhanced Logging

## Changes Made

I've added comprehensive debugging logs throughout the email sending process to help identify why emails aren't being received.

### Files Modified:

1. **EmailService.java** - Added detailed logging to `sendUserCreationEmail()`
2. **BrevoEmailService.java** - Added API call debugging
3. **AdminController.java** - Enhanced user creation logging + test endpoint

---

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Restart the Application

**IMPORTANT:** After making these changes, you MUST restart the Spring Boot application for the logs to take effect.

### Step 2: Create a Test User

Try creating a user via the admin panel and watch the console output carefully.

### Expected Console Output (Success):

```
üîÑ Attempting to send verification email...
   Email: test@example.com
   Username: testuser
   User ID: abc-123-def-456

üìß sendUserCreationEmail called

## Common Error Messages & Solutions

### Error 1: "Invalid API key" (HTTP 401)

**Problem:** Brevo API key is incorrect or expired

**Solution:**
1. Go to https://app.brevo.com/settings/keys/api
2. Copy your **v3 API Key**
3. Update `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   brevo.api.key=xkeysib-YOUR-ACTUAL-KEY-HERE
   ```
4. Restart the application

### Error 2: "Sender not verified" (HTTP 400)

**Problem:** The sender email (`ojtech.team@gmail.com`) is not verified in Brevo

**Solution:**
1. Go to https://app.brevo.com/senders
2. Check if `ojtech.team@gmail.com` is verified
3. If not, click "Add a sender" and verify it
4. Or change to a verified email in `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   spring.mail.email=your-verified-email@example.com
   ```

### Error 3: "Email is disabled" 

**Problem:** Email sending is turned off in configuration

**Solution:**
Check `application.properties`:
```properties
email.enabled=true  # Must be true
```

### Error 4: No error but no email received

**Possible causes:**
1. **Email went to spam** - Check spam/junk folder
2. **Brevo free tier limits reached** - Check https://app.brevo.com/statistics
3. **Email blocked by provider** - Try a different email address
4. **Delayed delivery** - Wait 5-10 minutes and check again

## Using the Test Email Endpoint

### Quick Email Test

Use the test endpoint to verify email configuration without creating a user:

**Request:**
```http
GET http://localhost:8081/api/admin/test-email?email=your-email@example.com
```

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Test email sent! Check inbox for: your-email@example.com"
}
```

**Console Output:**
```
üß™ Testing email service...
   Recipient: your-email@example.com

üîß BrevoEmailService.sendEmail() called
   To: your-email@example.com
   Subject: OJTech - Email Test
   ...

‚úì Test email sent successfully!
```

## Configuration Verification

spring.mail.email=ojtech.team@gmail.com

# Application Base URL
backend.base-url=http://localhost:8081
```

### Verify Each Value:

1. **email.enabled** = `true` ‚úì
2. **brevo.api.key** = Valid API key from Brevo dashboard
3. **brevo.api.url** = `https://api.brevo.com/v3/smtp/email` ‚úì
4. **spring.mail.email** = Verified sender email in Brevo
5. **backend.base-url** = Your backend URL (for verification links)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your application**
2. **Create a test user** or use the test endpoint
3. **Watch the console output** carefully
4. **Copy the exact error message** if there is one
5. **Check your Brevo dashboard** at https://app.brevo.com/statistics/email
